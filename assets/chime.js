/* The "you got it" sound, shared by every LevlPrep course.

   Every place in the site that tells you an answer was right now also says it
   out loud: the ochem lesson checks and mechanism drills, the ochem
   practice/review/diagnostic runner, and the NREMT lung-sound trainer. The
   NREMT practice exam is the deliberate exception — it withholds per-question
   feedback the way the real exam does, so a chime there would leak the answer.
   It gets the end-of-session flourish instead, when the score is finally
   revealed.

   Why synthesized rather than an audio file: a chime is ~12 lines of
   oscillator, and the alternative is shipping binary assets that the service
   worker then has to precache for offline use. Nothing to download, nothing to
   cache, no format fallbacks.

   Two details that make it feel like a reward instead of a beep:

     - The pitch climbs with the run. Six correct answers in a row walk up a
       pentatonic ladder, and a miss drops you back to the bottom. That is the
       whole reason `answer(false)` exists and has to be called on wrong
       answers too — without it the ladder would ratchet up and never come
       down, and the fifth right answer would sound exactly like the fiftieth.
     - Every note is two detuned oscillators through a lowpass, not one raw
       sine. A bare sine reads as a UI error tone; the beating between two
       near-identical voices is what makes it read as a bell.

   Off switch: the speaker button in the header (drawn by site-chrome.js),
   remembered in localStorage. */

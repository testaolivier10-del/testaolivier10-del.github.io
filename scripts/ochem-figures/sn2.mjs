  caption: 'The distinction this section keeps making, drawn once. A <b>transition state</b> is a maximum: the molecule is passing through it and cannot stop, which is why SN2 has no intermediate, never rearranges, and cannot lose track of which face the nucleophile came in on. An <b>intermediate</b> is a minimum — a dip the molecule can sit in — and everything odd about SN1 and E1 comes from what happens while it sits there.',
  note: 'Read the right-hand diagram for the rate too: with two barriers, the reaction can only go as fast as the taller one lets it, and here that is the first. This is why the SN1 rate law contains the substrate and nothing else — the nucleophile only turns up in the second hump, after the race has already been decided.',
